# Copilot guidance

See `AGENTS.md` for the project's working methodology and grading-critical rules: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)

Quick highlights (consult `AGENTS.md` before implementing):
- Operational Protocol: reference EX_01/EX_02 instructions first; provide a Plan of Action.
- Response Standards: explain design choices and include a TL;DR.
- Key Architectural Safeguards: use `orderId` as Kafka key and prefer manual commits to avoid data loss.
